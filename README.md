# Data-Mining-for-Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction
## Introduction
<p align = "justify"> 
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD’s) is a set of high-risk diseases, which affects the heart and blood vessels of the body. CVD is caused due to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, alcohol, smoking, etc. It can moreover affect other organs in the body such as the mind, kidneys and eyes. Sometimes
when it is not cured on time, it becomes the leading cause of death. </p>

Presently, the Medical Diagnosis System is playing an essential role in diagnosis and treatment. The project focuses on predicting the risk of Cardiovascular disease among patients using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.
The information is being extracted from the clinical records of the patient collected using Data Mining. This system’s automation will help the physicians for a fast and better diagnosis in the future with a reduction in costs. It also stresses
Data Analysis, which plays a vital role in the medical field’s progress by suggesting the proper treatment according to the patient’s characteristics.</p>

Various lifestyle factors are considered, such as age, blood pressure, weight, height, cholesterol, alcohol, activity, and many more, which play a significant role in the high risk of Cardiovascular Disease. Hence, a sound prediction system is required for cardiovascular disease so that people can
stay more healthy and safe. The main aim is to determine the individuals at higher risk of developing Cardio Vascular disease at an earlier stage to avoid premature deaths.</p> <br/>

## Data Understanding
<p align = "justify">
The Cardiovascular Disease dataset is obtained from Kaggle [1], in which the data was collected at the moment of medical examination. The data does not contain any directly
identifiable information. The dataset consists of 70,000 records of patient data, 11 features, and one target variable, which
gives the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease in the form of 1 or 0, respectively. All 12 features are broadly categorized into three categories:<br/>
&nbsp;• Objective: factual information;<br/>
&nbsp;• Examination: results of medical analysis;<br/>
&nbsp;• Subjective: the patient gave information.<br/></p>
